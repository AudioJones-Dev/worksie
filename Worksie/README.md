- vibe_designer_agent
- training_orchestrator_agent

## ⚙️ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/worksie.git
cd worksie
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔁 Deploy to Firebase

## 🤖 Train with Claude
Upload `worksie_training_schema.jsonl` and prompts into Claude Code and run:
```txt
"Use this schema and these agents to scaffold Worksie as a full-stack Firebase + React app."
```

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase for push notifications. To connect to your Firebase project, you will need to set up your environment variables.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** In the root of the `Worksie` directory, create a new file named `.env`.

2.  **Add your Firebase credentials:** Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials.

    ```
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY="YOUR_VAPID_KEY"
    ```

Once you have completed these steps, the application will be able to connect to your Firebase project and receive push notifications. The Firebase service worker is generated from the installed Firebase SDK version before `npm run dev` and `npm run build`, and it is configured automatically from the same Vite environment variables at registration time, so do not commit project-specific credentials into `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`. Browsers typically require `Notification.requestPermission()` to run in response to a user gesture, so call `requestForToken()` from a button click or similar opt-in flow when adding notification UI.

## 📡 Firebase Remote Config

This project uses Firebase Remote Config to allow for dynamic configuration of the application. The configuration is stored in the `config/worksie-remote-config.json` file.

### Importing the Configuration

You can import this configuration into your Firebase project using the Firebase CLI or the REST API.

**Using the REST API (example):**

1.  **Get an access token:**
    ```bash
    ACCESS_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
    ```

2.  **Push the configuration:**
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json; UTF-8" \
     -d @config/worksie-remote-config.json \
     "https://firebaseremoteconfig.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/remoteConfig"
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Firebase project ID.)

### Using the Configuration in the App

The application is already set up to fetch and use the Remote Config values. The main logic is in `src/logic/remoteConfig.js`.

The `PromoBanner` component and the primary color are currently controlled by Remote Config. You can extend this to other parts of the application as needed.
